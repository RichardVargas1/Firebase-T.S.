# Firebase-T.S.
Train Scheduler Homework Assignment.

This assignment will aloow the user to see train schedules, as well as their depart times.

Utilizing Firebase.

This assignment was fun. Gathering data and seeing what I put into my labels on Firebase.
I had some difficulty setting a certain time for the "Next Arrival" column. I thought if I would input a certain set time on the "First Train Train," that would show up in the column for the next arrival time. I probobly. Should've formatted my javascript to set a time I wanted, instead of actually setting the arrival time for when I make the schedule in the present time.
